# buttonspageus

This is a website that was developed completely by HTML and CSS. The purpose of this website is to highlight the different buttons. Keep in mind that these are only a few features of buttons, there are still many more and I will be creating another website showcasing them all. 

The first row highlights ROUNDED BUTTONS. They are not square and do not have corners, they are rounded. 
The second row highlights COLORED BORDER BUTTONS. Looking closely, you can notice that the border of the boxes in the second row are green. 
The third row highlights HOVERING BUTTONS. When you move your cursor on those buttons, it changes the color of the background from black to light blue. 
The fourth row highlights CLICKING BUTTONS. Use your cursor to click on the button, they do go in and the color changes from black to light blue. 
The fifth row FADE IN BUTTONS. Initially, the original opacity is light. When you move your cursor to those buttons, it changes color and becomes a darker black.
